About
----------

I'm a physicist at [NMPP](https://www.ipp.mpg.de/ippcms/de/for/bereiche/numerik), 
[IPP Garching](https://www.ipp.mpg.de/12411/garching) and teaching plasma physics
at [TU Graz](https://www.tugraz.at/).
Currently I am investigating techniques of uncertainty quantification
and model complexity reduction, with emphasis on Hamiltonian systems.
Other research topics include the theoretical and numerical
treatment of non-axisymmetric perturbations in tokamak plasmas,
structure-preserving solution of ordinary and partial differential equations
and the clever combination of analytical and numerical methods.
Besides plasma physics this applies to problems with application
in acoustics and engineering. 

There are always bachelor's and master's thesis topics available 
at the plasma physics group at TU Graz and at IPP Garching, 
if you're excited about nuclear fusion, theory and numerics,
don't be afraid to contact me!

If you'd like to know more about me, my
[CV](https://itp.tugraz.at/~ert/assets/cv.en.2019.pdf) is available for download and
my [electronic business
card](https://online.tugraz.at/tug_online/visitenkarte.show_vcard?pPersonenId=C21936EF50DC00EC&pPersonenGruppe=3)
at TU Graz is linked as well as my [publication list](https://graz.pure.elsevier.com/de/persons/christopher-albert/publications/).
